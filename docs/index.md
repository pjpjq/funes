# Building the memory

`funes index` builds or updates your local memory from session transcripts. [`funes add`](add.md)
runs it for you on every turn; run it by hand to seed a memory, to fold in a new source, or to index
sessions from a machine or agent that never ran the automation.

```bash
funes index      # a fast, text-first pass over every known harness dir, into one local memory
```

## What it indexes

With **no argument**, in a terminal, `funes index` sweeps every supported agent's session dir it
finds — `~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex/sessions`, `~/.pi/agent/sessions`, `~/.hermes/state.db` — into
one memory, then offers to finish any deeper work left. Scope it to a single agent with `--harness`:

```bash
funes index --harness codex        # only ~/.codex/sessions
```

Point it at a **path** to index one place in full — a transcript tree, a single `.parquet` trace
export, or a `.funes.jsonl` turns file (or a directory of them) — or at a **Hub trace repo** to index
its auto-converted parquet:

```bash
funes index ./some/session/tree            # a local transcript tree or .parquet
funes index thread.funes.jsonl             # turns from a source funes has no parser for
funes index <org>/<repo>                   # a Hub trace dataset (or a full hf://… URI)
```

An existing local path always wins over reading the same string as a repo ref. An **automated
(non-terminal) run must name a target** — a path or `--harness <name>`; funes refuses to sweep every
harness root unattended (a Claude session-end shouldn't pull in Codex or pi sessions).

### Parquet trace format

Parquet import targets the Hugging Face agent-traces layout: **one row per session**, with these two
required columns:

| Column | Arrow type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session_id` | `Utf8` or `LargeUtf8` | Stable identity for the session. |
| `messages` | `List<Utf8>` or `List<LargeUtf8>` | JSON-encoded, OpenAI-style chat messages in chronological order. |

Each non-null `messages` element is a JSON object. funes reads these fields:

| Field | Mapping |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | Turn role. |
| `content` | A `text` block when it is a non-empty string. |
| `reasoning_content` | A `thinking` block when it is a non-empty string. |
| `tool_calls[].function.name` | Tool name on a `tool_use` block. |
| `tool_calls[].function.arguments` | Tool input, kept as a string or serialized from its JSON value. |

The importer does not currently derive `tool_result` blocks from Parquet messages. Other message
fields are ignored. Invalid JSON elements are skipped; a row is skipped when none of its messages
produces an indexable block.

Optional string columns add provenance:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `sent_at` | Timestamp applied to the imported turns. |
| `harness` | Agent/harness facet; it may differ per row. |
| `file_path` | Original source path shown in provenance. |
| `metadata` | JSON object whose `cwd` becomes the workdir facet. |

When optional provenance is absent, funes falls back to the Parquet filename where possible. Turn
UUIDs are synthesized as `<session_id>-<sequence>` and sequence counts only retained messages. This
is the compatibility contract behind “another agent can join through a Parquet trace export”; an
arbitrary Parquet table is not accepted merely because it has a `.parquet` suffix.

### funes JSONL (turns files)

A source funes has no parser for — another coding agent, an issue tracker, a chat export — reaches
it as `.funes.jsonl`: funes's own turn model, one JSON object per line, written by a *producer*
outside funes. [The format](funes-jsonl.md) is the contract — field table, identity rule,
validation. What `funes index` does with one:

- **One file is one unit**, always re-read (chunk-id dedup makes that a no-op) and never recorded in
  `state.json`. One invalid line rejects the whole file and fails the run; nothing from it is written.
  **A directory** is one unit per file: a rejected file writes nothing, is reported with its first bad
  line, the run goes on, and the summary counts it under `rejected` with a non-zero exit. A directory
  holding any other `.jsonl` is refused as ambiguous.
- **The facets come from the data.** `harness` is each turn's own, so `--harness` is refused.
  `workdir` and `repo` derive from the turn's `cwd`, resolved on the indexing machine — the one
  derivation every native parser goes through too; a turn without `cwd` has neither facet.
- **`funes index --check <file-or-dir>`** runs the same read and validation, computes the chunk ids,
  and reports turns, chunks, rejected files and the ids a file produces twice (a turn re-emitted under
  its `turn_uuid` would be deduped away, never indexed) — writing nothing. Run it before you publish a
  producer.

## Incremental by construction

A chunk's id derives from `(session, turn, block, split)`, so a completed turn produces **exactly the
same chunks** no matter when it's indexed — and re-running embeds nothing already written. That is
what makes it cheap to re-run as you work, and what lets the per-turn hook do the same job as one
sweep at the end.

A no-path refresh is **budgeted and text-first**: it does a fast text pass and offers to backfill the
deeper content, so a large backlog fills in a bounded step at a time rather than one long stall. An
explicit path or Hub repo is indexed in full.

## Tiers and ordering

Blocks are indexed in three tiers, cheapest-and-highest-value first:

| Tier | Blocks | Why first |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L1 `text` | user and assistant prose, thinking | the decisions and rationale — where recall pays off |
| L2 `tool_use` | tool calls | context for what was done |
| L3 `tool_result` | tool output | bulky, lowest value per byte |

A budgeted (no-path) run drains these **tier-major**: it indexes *every* owed session at `text`
first — newest session first, subagents last — then every session at `tool_use`, then at
`tool_result`, checking a ~60s wall-clock budget at each whole-session boundary and stopping at the
first one past it. So the whole memory becomes recallable at the decision/rationale level within
about a minute, and the bulky tool output backfills on later runs (the per-turn hook, or a rerun) a
bounded step at a time. `--no-thinking` drops thinking blocks from the `text` tier; an explicit path
or Hub repo skips the budget and indexes all tiers in one pass.

Inline `data:` URI payloads are elided to `data:image/png;base64,[elided]` before a block is
scanned or stored: a pasted screenshot is megabytes of base64 with nothing recallable in it.

## Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--harness <name>` | Override auto-detection for a path, or (with no path) target one harness's dir: `claude \| codex \| pi \| hermes`. Refused on a turns file, whose turns name their own. |
| `--check` | Validate PATH without indexing it: turns, chunks, rejected files, duplicate ids; writes nothing, exits non-zero on any problem. |
| `--limit <N>` | Index only the most recent N sessions per source. Omit to index all. A Hub repo ignores it and indexes every shard. |
| `--no-thinking` | Exclude thinking blocks. |
| `--yes` | Don't ask: a budgeted (no-path) run finishes all remaining work; an explicit path skips the first-index size confirmation. |

## The pipeline

Indexing and recall are one deterministic pipeline:

```
~/.claude/projects, ~/.codex/sessions, ~/.pi/agent/sessions, ~/.hermes/state.db
   (or a .parquet trace, or a .funes.jsonl turns file)
   │  parse        deterministic — turns (text / thinking / tool_use / tool_result), tagged by agent
   │  chunk        one chunk per content block, tight provenance
   │  embed        pinned local model (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)
   ▼  store        a local Lance dataset (vector + BM25)
```

The embedding model is **pinned and stamped into the memory**; querying with a different one is
refused. To change it, rebuild from the transcripts — the memory is a disposable derived artifact, and
the raw text is retained in every row.

Each source is a `TraceSource` that reads its format into a generic turn/block shape; everything
downstream is source-agnostic. A memory runs ~2.3 KB/chunk and grows ~6 MB on a heavy day — see
[storage.md](storage.md).
