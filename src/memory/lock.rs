//! Serializes writers to the local memory: concurrent writers can lose, duplicate, or orphan rows
//! (Lance's commit guard doesn't prevent it on a local dataset), so at most one mutates at a time. It
//! lives in the binary, not a launcher script, so the rule holds for every writer however it started.
//! An advisory `flock`, released on drop and on process death; contention fails loudly, never blocks.
//! Readers take no lock — Lance gives each a consistent snapshot. [`try_lock_file`] exposes the same
//! `flock` on any path, for the binary's other advisory locks.
