# Automating funes

`funes index` is incremental and cheap, but you still have to *remember* to run it. `funes add`
wires the indexing — and, with a shared memory, the publishing — into your agent, so every turn is
captured automatically with no manual step. This document explains what `funes add` sets up and how
it behaves; you rarely need to touch any of it by hand.

*Different agents, one memory: Claude picks an embedding model; a session-end hook indexes it on its own; Codex — a separate agent — uses funes to recall the decision. No `funes` command in sight — the hooks do the capturing.*

*Look closely at Codex's hits: some timestamps predate this recording. Those are earlier takes of this very demo — funes had already memorized the rehearsals. An append-only memory has no clean take, so we kept the Droste effect rather than pretend otherwise.*

## What `funes add` sets up

`funes add claude`, `funes add codex`, `funes add pi`, and `funes add hermes` install, beyond the
read tools:

- **Per-turn indexing.** A per-turn hook runs `funes index` after every completed turn, so your
  local memory tracks the session as it grows — a session killed mid-flight is already indexed up to
  its last completed turn. Each run is time-boxed (text first, ~60s), so a large backlog fills in a
  bounded step per turn instead of one long sweep.
- **Publishing at session boundaries.** Bind a shared memory — `funes add <agent> <org>/<repo>` — and
  session-boundary hooks run `funes push` to publish there. Without a memory, indexing is local-only
  and nothing is published.

It also performs the one-time bootstrap steps, so nothing is left to run by hand after it:

- **Builds your first index** (from that agent's sessions) if you don't have one yet — a fast,
  text-first pass that gets recall working in about a minute, after asking. Deeper content and older
  sessions backfill on later turns. The hooks alone would also fill a cold memory, one bounded step
  per turn; `funes add` builds the most valuable part upfront so recall works from your first
  session.
- **Does the first push** to a freshly-bound memory. The push hook can't: a first publish to a memory
  your local memory shares no chunks with is refused off a terminal (the wrong-memory guard, below),
  so it must be interactive — `funes add` handles it.

Re-run `funes add <agent> <org>/<repo>` any time to change the memory or refresh the setup — it's
idempotent.

## How it's wired

Indexing per turn produces **exactly the same chunks** as indexing once at the end: a chunk's id
derives from `(session, turn, block, split)`, so a completed turn's chunks are identical no matter
when they're indexed, and `funes index` re-embeds nothing already written. Keeping the network step
(the push) off the per-turn path is what lets indexing run every turn cheaply.

- **Claude Code** has a plugin system, so funes ships a hooks-only plugin (extracted to
  `~/.funes/integrations/claude-plugin`) and registers it with `claude plugin marketplace add` +
  `claude plugin install`. Claude's loader activates the plugin's hooks — **funes never edits your
  `settings.json`**. `funes remove claude` removes the plugin, its local marketplace registration,
  the extracted source, and the separate MCP registration.
- **pi** has no hook system: it exposes its lifecycle to extensions instead, so the automation rides
  in the extension that already gives pi the read tools — the same scripts, run from `turn_end` and
  the session-boundary events. Nothing outside `~/.funes/integrations/pi` is configured, so
  `funes remove pi` takes the whole install with it.
- **Codex** has no plugin system, so funes writes its hooks into `~/.codex/hooks.json` — a file
  dedicated to hooks, not your `config.toml`. The merge is append-or-replace keyed by funes's own
  scripts, so any hooks you added yourself are left untouched. It also installs a small skill at
  `~/.codex/skills/funes/` — Codex's own skills root, rather than the `~/.agents/skills` tree other
  harnesses read — so Codex recognizes funes as memory before it loads any of its tools.
  **Codex runs a hook only once you have trusted it**, so after installing — and again after any
  change to a funes hook — run `/hooks` in Codex and review them; until then it skips them and
  nothing is indexed or published
  ([Codex docs](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks#review-and-trust-hooks)).
- **Hermes** (indexing is **beta**) declares shell hooks in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. funes merges a `post_llm_call` index
  hook (fired once per completed turn) and, with a memory, `on_session_finalize` + `on_session_start`
  publish hooks into that file — remove-then-add keyed by funes's own scripts, so your other hooks
  and config keys are left untouched (comments aren't preserved, as hermes' own `memory setup`
  rewrites the file the same way). Hermes gates shell hooks behind a consent allowlist
  (`~/.hermes/shell-hooks-allowlist.json`); funes pre-writes its own approvals so the hooks run from
  the first turn.

`funes remove codex` and `funes remove hermes` surgically remove only hook entries whose commands
invoke funes's scripts, then remove the scripts and their `funes-sync.log`; other hooks, approvals,
and config keys remain. Removing an integration never deletes the indexed memory or source
transcripts.

Every agent drives the same two scripts, installed alongside: `funes-index.sh` (the per-turn
local index) and `funes-push.sh` (the network publish). Each drains the hook payload and re-execs a
detached worker, so the hook returns in well under a second and never blocks the turn or trips a
timeout.

## Other agents

An agent funes has no parser for joins through the same shape: its per-turn hook runs a converter
that writes the session as a [`.funes.jsonl` turns file](funes-jsonl.md), then `funes index <that
file>`. Three things to know when writing one: an explicit path is indexed in full, unbudgeted — a
single session is small, so that is what you want; a run that finds the memory lock busy fails fast,
and the next turn's run catches up (indexing is idempotent); and `funes index --check <file>`
validates a producer's output without writing anything, so run it before wiring the hook.

## How it behaves

- **Local-first, always safe.** The index hook only ever writes your local memory; only the push hook
  touches the network — and with no memory bound, there's no push hook at all.
- **Fresh every turn.** Each completed turn re-indexes; because indexing is incremental, the
  re-sweep is cheap.
- **The boundary publish indexes first.** The per-turn index detaches, so a session's last turn may
  still be landing when the boundary fires; the publish hook sweeps the harness itself (retrying
  while the per-turn writer holds the memory lock) and then pushes, rather than leaving that turn to
  the next session's catch-up.
- **Published at the boundaries you have.** Claude publishes on `SessionEnd` and again on
  `SessionStart` (catching up anything a missed `SessionEnd` left behind — a disconnect, a closed
  window). Hermes publishes on `on_session_finalize` (its true session end) and again on
  `on_session_start` (the same catch-up). pi publishes on `session_shutdown`, and on `session_start`
  only when the process is fresh — its other starts follow a shutdown that just published. Codex
  publishes on the same pair, `SessionEnd` and `SessionStart`. Binding a memory needs Codex 0.151.0,
  the release this is verified against, and an older one is refused rather than left silently
  unpublished.
- **Serialized in the binary.** funes holds an advisory lock while it mutates the local memory, so
  only one writer touches it at a time, whatever launched it (a hook, a manual `funes index`, `funes
  scrub`). A run that hits the lock fails loudly and re-sweeps next turn (indexing is idempotent).
  Reads take no lock. `funes push` takes one of its own, per remote memory — it only reads the local
  memory, so it never blocks an index — and a publish that finds another in flight steps aside; the
  next session start sweeps it. Nothing is serialized across machines: two hosts publishing to one
  memory still race on the Hub.
- **Secrets held back.** funes redacts credentials at index time; on push, a separate always-on gate
  withholds any chunk that still contains one — the clean rows publish, and the push exits non-zero
  (code `2`) only if that leaves nothing to publish. Run `funes scrub`, then the next push includes it.
- **The card rides along.** A push to a memory at the repo root creates the repo's dataset card
  (tagged `funes`) and keeps its stats fresh — in the same commit as the data. A hand-written
  card is never touched.
- **The wrong-memory guard.** A first push to a memory your local memory shares no chunks with (a first
  push, a new host, or the wrong memory) is refused off a terminal. `funes add` clears it by doing
  that first push interactively — so on a new host, re-run `funes add <agent> <org>/<repo>` there
  once, as soon as that host has an index of its own to push.
- **The remaining gap.** A session's last turns publish no later than the next session's start; a
  machine retired without starting another session keeps its last unpushed turns local. Run `funes
  push <org>/<repo>` by hand before stepping away if that matters.
