//! One module per command: what funes does when you run it. They orchestrate the layers below —
//! read sessions through [`crate::traces`], chunk and embed them, write to or read from a
//! [`crate::memory`], and present the result through [`crate::ui`] — and they are where the
//! decisions live. Every state they act on is one the layers below report; nothing here infers it.
